# Travelbook
Simple iOS app that allows you to save GPS coordinates using a map.

I created this app with the help of Rob Percival's iOS developer course. It lets you save locations for future reference using your current location and iOS built-in map library.

I plan to include features that allow you to see nearby events in the future.
